Welcome to my Monty Hall Paradox Python Program! 

I took inspiration from this program from watching the relevant episode on Mythbusters.

Here is how this program works,

You are on a game show, and the host asks you to select a random door between 1 through 3. The game 
show host will open an empty door. The host will then ask if you want to keep the door you selected
 or change your selection to the other door. According to the Paradox, it is better to switch doors.
  
This program will keep a running tally of wins, losses, and how many times you switched doors. 

To run, download the files and run app.py. Have Fun
